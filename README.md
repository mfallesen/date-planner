# Date Planner
This is a rework of a previous app found [here](https://mfallesen.github.io/plannerly/) with its accompanying GitHub[Repo](https://github.com/mfallesen/plannerly).
This rework is utilizing a new framework (for me in any case) Semantic-UI-React. The idea is to rework this application to the same functionality that the old application had but as a react application. Further iteration on this application would involve UI refinement as well as expanding the services the application can provide.
